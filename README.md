# Predicting-well-status-in-Alberta-for-Untapped-Energy-Data-Science-Competition

This is the script submitted to the Untapped Energy reClaim Data competition : Classification challenge. 
The model created in this script was placed 5th in competition with over a 90 percent and a similar model place 4th in the Untapped Energy reClaim Data competition : Regression challenge
In this competition I used data (such as drilling date, well depth, location) from over 700,000 wells to predict the status of 
a well (classification) and initial production of the well (regression). xgboost and tensorflow were used to make the predictions and used pandas and scikit-learn to preprocess the data.
